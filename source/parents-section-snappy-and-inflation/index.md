Questions:

1\. Does inflation increase or decrease the value of bonds that your family own?

2\. What does the government do to quell inflation?

3\. Does inflation make your family’s home mortgage payment more or less valuable?

4\. If your allowance goes up during inflation, but you have to spend the extra income to buy the same toy, are you better off with inflation, even though you have more money to spend?

5\.  Does the price-to-earnings ratio of most stocks go up or down when inflation goes up?

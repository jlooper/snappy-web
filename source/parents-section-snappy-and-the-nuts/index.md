Parents, here are some questions that will stimulate conversation with your child about your finances. Use these as a guide while reading the books; clicking on the ladybug offers in-text questions as well.

1\. Where does our family have our bank account?

2\. Do we deal with our bank in person, or by mail, or by computer link?

3\. What kind of accounts do we have at our bank?

4\. How do we get our money out of the bank when we want to?

5\. What kind of records do we keep about our account(s)?

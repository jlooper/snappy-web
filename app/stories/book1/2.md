# The Nuts

Sometimes the Deer brothers trampled them and broke the nut shells. Often the naughty Chipmunk family stole them. Sometimes, Snappy couldnâ€™t quite remember where he put the piles of nuts.  Still, Snappy had been working for a long time and had saved many nuts.  They would taste so good all winter when the ground is covered with snow.

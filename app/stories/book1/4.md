# Owl's Forest Bank

Auntie Pip told Snappy that the forest has lots of good places to store his property.  “If you want them back within the next year or so, they'll have to be where we can find them easily but will be held safe from other Forest creatures.  I'd suggest Owl's Forest Bank.  You can put them in his safe box where he can watch them all the time.  Lots of animals store their things with Owl. He is awake all night and during the day he has several salamanders who watch what is held in the bank.”

# Snappy and the Nuts

Snappy was a busy, happy squirrel.  All day long in the fall he searched through the leaves on the forest floor for tasty nuts to store for the long winter.  He squeaked with excitement each time he found a nut and quickly buried it where he was sure heâ€™d find it in the coming months.  He had to hide them because other animals wanted to eat them, too.
